# Elevator-Simulator

The objective of the Elevator app is to simulate the operation of an elevator and more importantly, how to handle the events generated when the buildings occupants use it. This app simulates occupants calling for an elevator from any floor and pressing the buttons inside the elevator to indicate the floor they wish to go to.


### Constraints

- You must implement a single event handler for the up and down buttons on
each floor. For example, if there are 4 floors a single event handler should
be implemented rather than 8 (two buttons per floor).
- Similarly, a single event handler should be implemented for all buttons on
the control panel in the elevator rather than a unique event handler for each
button.
